BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
This folder contains a Makefile for building two executables: cuda_solve and
mkl_solve. Both are created by the same Makefile by running:

>> make

However, in order to successfully build mkl_solve, environment variables must be
properly set. This can be done by by running the following scripts which are
contained in the $INTELROOT directory (which houses the MKL distribution):

>> source $INTELROOT/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
>> source $INTELROOT/mkl/bin/mklvars.sh intel64

In addition, the environment varible $ICC must be set to point the icc compiler.

-------------------
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
The cuda_solve executable has 2 modes:
1) Supply three arguments: matrix dimension, bandwidth, number of right hand sides, e.g.:

>> ./cuda_solve 100 31 10

This generates random A (diagonally dominant) and b matricies and outputs the inclusive execution time.


2) Supply five arguments: file name of of A matrix, file name of b matrix, 
   matrix dimension, bandwidth number of right hand sides e.g.:

>> ./cuda_solve test_A test_b 3 3 2

The A matrix must be given in band form in a row major order. The b matrix must be given in
column major order. Note that the files test_A and test_b are present in this
directory. The output is the solution (x) to standard output.

The all of the other executables (mkl_solve, omp_solve, serial_solve, omp_solve_slow)  have 
one mode which is identical to the first mode of cuda_solve, e.g.:

>> ./mkl_solve 100 31 10
